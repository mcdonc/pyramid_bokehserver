Goals:

- Make it more convenient to deploy only a single process representing
  both the bokeh server and a user's application.

- Make it more convenient to override existing views (such as login / logout /
  registration views)

- Make it more convenient to reuse the security framework provided by
  bokeh server

- Split authentication and authorization into two separate subsystems for
  convenience.  Many onsite customer deployments will often need to override
  one or the other, but perhaps not both.

New features that come along for the ride:

- Make it possible to run more than one bokeh server app in a single
  process (e.g. with paste.urlmap prefix middleware).

- Side-effect-less imports.
